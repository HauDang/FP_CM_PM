# Fracture propagation (FP) accounting for contact mechanics (CM) in poroelastic media (PM) (developing)
Numerical solution for coupling fluid flow and fracture propagation in porous media due to fluid injection

1. Using a finite volume - finite element framework
2. Refinement and remeshing at tips
3. Splitting a face to create a new fracture
4. Running nonlinear, time-dependent on model
5. Mapping solution between different grids
